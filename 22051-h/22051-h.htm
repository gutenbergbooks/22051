<h2>IN THE NAME OF CHARITY&mdash;GO
TO PRISON!</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Last</span> week <i>Mr. Punch</i> asked, "Oh,
where, and oh where, is The Public Prosecutor?" and he has received an
answer. It appears that the official has been recently engaged (his
letter is dated the 30th of November) in suppressing an "illegal scheme"
to aid the funds of the North-West London Hospital. It appears that,
with a view to increasing the revenue of that most deserving charity, it
was arranged to treat some presents that had been made to the
Institution as "prizes," to be given to those who sent donations to the
hospital. There was to be a "drawing," which was to be duly advertised
in the daily papers. But this could not be tolerated.
Sir <span class="smcap">A. K. Stephenson</span>, Solicitor to Her
Majesty's Treasury, after denouncing the scheme in the terms above set
forth, informed the Secretary of the Hospital, "that all persons
concerned therein subjected themselves to the penalties imposed by the
Acts passed for the suppression of illegal lotteries." Well, the law is
the law, and it would never do for <i>Mr. Punch</i> to dispute the point
with so learned a gentleman as Sir <span class="smcap">A. K.
Stephenson</span>&mdash;the more especially as Sir A. K. S. has just
been patented a Q.C.&mdash;but if the Public Prosecutor can stop
"illegal schemes" for benefiting the sick, why can he not also deal with
the professional perjurers, suborners of witnesses, and fabricators of
false evidence? <i>Mr. Punch</i> pauses for a reply, but is disinclined
to pause much longer!</p>

<hr class='half' />

<p><span class="smcap">Our Turn Now.</span>&mdash;An excited paragraph
in the morning papers announces that "two Doctors of Vienna have
succeeded in discovering the Influenza <i>bacillus</i> after a series of
experiments in the Chemical and Physiological Laboratory of the
University." This is capital. Hitherto the Influenza <i>bacillus</i> has
discovered <i>us</i>. Now the tables are turned, and the question is,
What shall we do with our prize? A little transaction in boiling lead
might not be bad to begin with.</p>

<h2>A "FISH OUT OF WATER" AT GREENWICH.</h2>

<p>In a not very wise speech delivered while presiding at the opening of
a new series of lectures in connection with the Greenwich Branch of the
Society for the Extension of University Teaching, Lord
<span class="smcap">Wolseley</span> modestly admitted "that whatever information he had
acquired in life had been acquired from the ordinary penny newspaper
which he had read day by day." No doubt this rather
humiliating fact accounts for the florid style of the proclamations
"Our Only General" used to publish in Egypt and elsewhere&mdash;proclamations
at the time recognised as having the tone of Astley's
in the good old days of the <i>Battle of Waterloo</i> and other military
melodramas. However, if it pleases Lord <span class="smcap">Wolseley</span> to give materials
for a future biography, that is no one's concern but his own.
Unfortunately he touched upon another matter, about which he
knows evidently very little, if anything at all. His Lordship spoke
in very disrespectful terms of what he called the "Shilling Dreadful,"
which, he declared (in this instance accurately enough), was "prized
by many people." Certainly the novelette is more popular than <i>The
Soldier's Pocket-book</i>, although both <i>brochures</i> are equally works of
imagination. So it should be, considering that amongst the authors
who have produced it have been <span class="smcap">Wilkie Collins</span>, <span class="smcap">Hugh Conway</span>,
<span class="smcap">F. Anstey</span>, <span class="smcap">Robert Buchanan</span>, <span class="smcap">Grant Allen</span>, <span class="smcap">Walter Besant</span>,
<span class="smcap">Rhoda Broughton</span>, and others equally well known to fame. He concluded
by remarking, "that if men of all politics were to be shaken
up in a bag, he believed there would be very little difference between
them." Quite true, if the bag were shaken sufficiently long to complete
the transformation&mdash;but it would be rather a brutal experiment!</p>

</div>

<h2>A PAGE FROM A DIARY.</h2>

<p class='subtitle'> (<i>Purely Imaginary.</i>)</p>

<p><i>First Week.</i>&mdash;Now let me see what I have to do. I will
leave out of consideration my extra-parliamentary utterances&mdash;they
will take care of themselves. Shan't forget
<i>them</i>. But other matters. Well, I have to turn the works
of my dear old friend <span class="smcap">Alf Tennyson</span> into Greek&mdash;of course, omitting certain highly injudicious lines of a reactionary
character. Then I must read through the last edition of
the <i>Encyclop&aelig;dia Britannica</i>. No skipping, but go through
<i>every</i> article thoroughly and conscientiously. Then, of
course, there is Grand Day at Gray's Inn. Must <i>not</i> forget
that. Should like, above all things, to be present. Now let
me see that I have got the date all right. Yes, I remember.
Grand Day, Hilary Term. Falls on a Thursday. I shan't forget.</p>

<p><i>Second Week.</i>&mdash;Translation
of <span class="smcap">Tennyson</span> into Greek going on famously. Not
had time to cut down any trees, so busy have I been. Got as far as
"Foghorn" in <i>Encyclop&aelig;dia Britannica</i>. New edition a very
good one. Glad I made up my mind to read it. Let me see, anything else?
Why, to be sure, Grand Day at Gray's Inn! Rather cut off my hand or even
my head, than forget <i>that</i>! Treasurer particularly nice man. So
are all the Benchers. So are all the Barristers and the Students.
Excellent fellows, all of them&mdash;yes, excellent. So must not forget
Grand Day at Gray's Inn. To be sure. Falls on a Thursday.</p>

<p><i>Third Week.</i>&mdash;<i>A. T.</i> progressing nicely. Little
difficulty about the translation of the <i>Northern Farmer</i>. Rather
awkward to give the proper weight of a country dialect in Greek.
However, it reads very well, indeed! Think my dear old
friend <span class="smcap">Alf</span> will be pleased with it; he should
be, as it has given me a good deal of trouble. However, all's well that
ends well. <i>E. B.</i> also satisfactory. Got into the "D's." Article
upon the "Docks," scarcely exhaustive enough to please me, so have been
reading some other books upon the same subject. Forgotten nothing? No,
because I remember I have to dine at Gray's Inn. Yes, to be
sure&mdash;23rd of January. Grand Day. Hilary Term. Falls on a Thursday.
Would not forget it to save my election! Looking forward to the port.
Excellent port at Gray's Inn, I am told. Well, well, I shall be there! I
don't believe much in artificial memory, but to assist my recollection,
I have tied knots in all my pocket-handkerchiefs. Wouldn't forget the
fixture for a kingdom. Falls on a Thursday.</p>

<p><i>Fourth Week.</i>&mdash;Finished Greek translation
of <span class="smcap">Tennyson's</span> Poems. Very pleased with the
result. Must send a copy to dear old <span class="smcap">Alf</span>.
Perhaps it might suggest to him that it would be a graceful compliment
in return to translate all my speeches into Latin verse. Dear old
friend! There is not another man to whom I would entrust such a task
with equal heartiness. He would do it <i>so</i> well. Must look up my
earlier orations. If <span class="smcap">Alf</span> does <i>any</i> of
it, he should do it <i>all</i>. I do not believe in half measures.
Nearly finished the <i>E. B.</i> Article upon "Music" very interesting.
"Pigs" not so good; however "Wheel-barrows" excellent and exhaustive.
Rather angry to find knots in my handkerchiefs, &amp;c., until I
suddenly remembered they were to remind me of my engagement to dine at
Gray's Inn. To be sure. Grand Day, Hilary Term. Falls on a Thursday.
Sure to be a delightful evening. Several of my young Irish friends are
members of the Society. I am looking forward to it <i>so</i> much.
Useful things, knots. Remembered it at once! Tie them again. Also
put <i>grey</i> wideawake hat over clock in my study. That will remind
me of <i>Gray's</i> Inn. Falls on a Thursday!</p>

<p><i>Last Week.</i>&mdash;There, now I can come to this book with a
clear conscience. Done everything. Greek translation of
<span class="smcap">Tennyson</span> ready for press. Finished letter "Z" last night,
in final volume of the <i>Encyclop&aelig;dia Britannica</i>. Nothing
omitted. Rather annoyed to find someone has been tying
knots in my handkerchief. Hate practical jokes! Careless
person, too, has been hanging my old grey wideawake on the
clock in my study. Rather a liberty! Don't like liberties.
Always courteous to <i>everybody</i>&mdash;consequently, expect <i>everybody</i>
to be courteous to <i>me</i>! Still, can't help smiling. It
<i>was</i> a quaint idea to hang my old wideawake on the clock in
my study. I wonder what put such a freak into the joker's
head! Now let me look at the paper that has just reached
me from London. Dear me, "The Vacant Chair." That seems
a good title. And all about Gray's Inn! Now, I like
Gray's Inn&mdash;a most excellent place; everyone connected with
it great friends of mine. And writing of Gray's Inn, that
reminds me&mdash;Good gracious! Why, last night was
Thursday, and I forgot to be there!!!</p>

<h2>MENU-BETTING.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Gentlemen</span> who bet on every event in
life&mdash;who cut cards to decide whether they shall go into the City
by cab or by underground train, and toss up to see whether they had
better dine at home or at the Club, may be interested to know of a new
game of chance which can be played at dinnertime, and in which ladies
not only may but must take part. "Betting on the <i>menu</i>" it is
called; and it is done in this way. You ask the lady next to you on the
right&mdash;the one you have taken in to dinner&mdash;permission to
speculate as to what dishes she will choose from among those inscribed
on the <i>menu</i>; and you back your selection in a series of bets
either with the lady herself, or&mdash;if she happens not to be what the
French call "<i>sportive</i>"&mdash;with any gentleman who may be
willing to do business with you. Suppose the lady takes you? You make a
pencil-mark against each dish which, it seems to you, she will fancy;
and if you are right more often than you are wrong, you win&mdash;and
the lady does not pay you. In the contrary case you lose&mdash;and you
pay the lady. It need scarcely be said that you annotate your own copy
of the <i>menu</i>, and that the lady does not see it until the dinner
is at an end. The same principle is observed in betting with a gentleman
in reference to a lady's probable selection; but in this latter case
neither of the parties interested is at liberty to express any opinion,
directly or indirectly, as to the merits or demerits of the different
dishes from which the lady has to choose. Any member of the unfair sex
may make sure of winning from her antagonist&mdash;who will naturally
have marked a certain number of dishes&mdash;by simply abstaining from
food throughout the dinner; though the lady of the house might think
this impolite. <i>Menu</i>-betting is in any case an agreeable pastime
for both sexes. It promotes digestion; and any woman of moderate ability
may make money by it.</p>

<hr class='half' />

<p>"<span class="smcap">More Light!</span>"&mdash;The British Museum is,
it appears, presently to be opened at night, its (Elgin) marble halls
and others being illuminated with the electric light. Concurrently with
this happy event Mr. <span class="smcap">Louis Fagan</span>, of the

<p class="smcap">Near-sighted Man in Church, inspecting Sham
Insect on Lady's Bonnet. He is so excited by the discovery, that he
hurries out of Church in the middle of the Service, in order to write to

<h2>AMONG THE AMATEURS.</h2>

<p class='center'>No. IV.&mdash;RETROSPECT.</p>

<blockquote><p><span class="smcap">Scene</span>&mdash;<i>A large Room,
in which Guests are assembling previous to a Supper in honour of a Great
Actor, who is about to leave for a tour to the United States. There has
been a magnificent farewell performance, in which the Great Actor has
surpassed himself. The public has shown unparalleled enthusiasm; the G.
A. has appeared before the Curtain, and in a voice choked with emotion
has assured his audience that the one thing that sustains him at this
trying moment is the prospect of seeing them all again when he
returns.</i></p>

<p><span
class="smcap">Time</span>&mdash;11.45 <span
class="smcap lower">P.M.</span> <i>The Room is full of histrionic, literary,
and artistic Celebrities, with a few stray Barristers and Doctors, who
like to show publicly that in spite of the arduous labours of their
professions, they can enjoy a mild dissipation as well as any man. Most
of the leading lights of the "Thespian
Perambulators,"</i> <span
class="smcap">Boldero</span>, <span class="smcap">Tiffington
Spinks</span>, <span
class="smcap">Gushby</span>, <span class="smcap">Andrew
Jarp</span>, <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Hall</span>, <i>have come to
prove by their presence the sympathy of the Amateur Stage. On the last
night but one they had concluded their series of performances at
Blankbury. The Chairman of the Banquet is a middle-aged Peer, who is a
regular attendant at first nights, and occupies a subordinate office in
the Ministry. The Guest of the Evening has not yet arrived. A buzz of
conversation fills the air. The Secretary of the Banquet, an actor, is
anxiously hurrying about with a list, on which he ticks off
names.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><i>The Secretary</i> (<i>to</i> <span class="smcap">Boldero</span>).
So glad all you fellows have been able to come. I've put you pretty well
together, as you wished. I wonder where&mdash;oh! here he is at
last.</p>

<blockquote><p><i>Enter Great Actor. The Secretary rushes to him.
Hand-shakings and congratulations all round. The G. A. moves up the room
to where the Amateurs are standing.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><i>G. A.</i> (<i>shaking hands.</i>) Ah! this is really
friendly, <span class="smcap">Tiffington</span>, really friendly. Were
you in front to-night?</p>

<p><i>Tiffington.</i> Of course we were. We wouldn't have missed it for
a thousand pounds. It went first class. I thought your idea of
stabbing <span class="smcap">Alphonso</span> from behind instead of in
front, was a genuine inspiration.</p>

<p><i>G. A.</i> Approbation from Sir <span class="smcap">Hubert</span>.
(<i>Bows and leaves quotation unfinished</i>). But I've always played it
like that, I think.</p>

<p class='ralign'>[<i>Supper is announced. The Guests troop in to the
supper-room.</i></p>

<p><i>Tiffington</i> (<i>to</i> <span class="smcap">Jarp</span>, <i>as
they walk in</i>). He's wrong there. Never did it like that before; and,
after all, I'm not sure it is such an improvement. But if you don't
praise these fellows they never forgive you.</p>

<p><i>Jarp.</i> Didn't he say anything about our show at Blankbury? I
thought you wrote to him about it.</p>

<p><i>Tiffington.</i> So I did; wrote specially to tell him how well
things had gone off. But you might just as well try to pump wine out of
a pillar-box, as expect a word of sympathy or encouragement from a
professional. They're all the same.</p>

<p class='ralign'>[<i>They take their
seats,</i> <span
class="smcap">Tiffington</span> <i>and</i> <span
class="smcap">Jarp</span> <i>on one side of the table, the other three
opposite them. The supper begins.</i></p>

<p><i>Friend of the G. A.</i>
(<i>on</i> <span class="smcap">Tiffington</span>'s <i>right</i>).
Splendid performance, was it not? I never saw him in finer form in my
life. It's quite impossible to imagine anything more dignified and
pathetic than his death-scene.</p>

<p><i>Tiffington</i> (<i>dubiously</i>). Hum! Yes. I'm not sure I should
do it like that quite. What do you
say, <span class="smcap">Gushby</span>?</p>

<p><i>Gushby.</i> It's not my idea at all. He spins it out far too long.
I should like to see you act that, <span class="smcap">Tiff</span>.</p>

<p><i>Tiffington</i> (<i>complacently</i>). Ah, well, so you might if
things were managed with common fairness. But (<i>bitterly</i>) you know
well enough there's a regular conspiracy against me. (<i>To Friend of G.
A.</i>) Now, of course, you've read the notices of our performance
of <i>Heads or Tails</i>? Yes. I thought you had. Well, you <i>must</i>
have observed, that I don't get more than two lines in any one of them,
not a word more than two lines upon my soul, and yet any fool knows that
my part was the chief one. But there you are. The beggars daren't abuse
me. They know the public won't stand that, so, just to spite me, they
try to leave me out. But they're very much mistaken if they think I
care. Pooh! I snap my fingers at them and their wretched conspiracy.</p>

<p class='ralign'>[<i>Snaps them, and drinks moodily. The supper proceeds.
Conversation everywhere ranges over all kinds of
topics,&mdash;literature, art, the drama, the political situation, the
last Divorce Case. The Amateurs continue to discuss
themselves.</i></p>

<p><i>Jarp</i> (<i>to</i> <span class="smcap">Boldero</span>). Did you
see that infamous notice in <i>The Moonbeam</i>? Just like that
rascal <span class="smcap">Penfold</span>. He can't help showing his
jealousy, because we never asked him to join the Perambulators.</p>

<p><i>Boldero.</i> Yes. There you have it in a nutshell. I tell you what
it is, we shall have to exclude all critics from our show in future.</p>

<p><i>Tiffington.</i> Ah! that would punish them&mdash;and serve them
right, too. Are you going to sing
to-night, <span class="smcap">Hall</span>?</p>

<p><i>Hall</i> (<i>with a sigh of resignation</i>). I suppose I shall
have to. I told <span class="smcap">Batterdown</span> I should be ready,
if wanted.</p>

<p><i>Jarp.</i> Have you got anything new?</p>

<p><i>Hall.</i> Rather. Something particularly neat, I think. I call it
"<i>The Super at Supper</i>." It goes like this:&mdash;</p>

<p class='ralign'>[<i>Hums to his friends, who listen with rapt
attention, occasionally interchanging glances expressive of enthusiastic
admiration.</i></p>

<div class="poem">

<p><i>The Chairman</i> (<i>concluding</i>). Therefore I bid you all

<h2>THE SHREWING OF THE TAME.</h2>

<p>
<span class="smcap">Dear Mr. Punch</span>,<br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. F. R. Benson</span> deserves commendation for
a new idea.
<span class="smcap">Shakspeare</span> has been presented in many forms, but the notion of
giving the Bard without any acting to speak of is a novelty. And
it is not quite certain that it is a mistake. After all, a bad actor is
an infliction, and it is better to have gentlemen who have not spent
centuries in mastering the intricacies of their profession than a noisy
personage who tears his passions to atoms. The recent revivals of
<i>A Midsummer Night's Dream</i> and the <i>Taming of the Shrew</i> at the
Globe Theatre show how pleasing Shakspearian representations may
be made, even when their success depends less upon elocution than
scenic effect. The first of these plays was simply delightful, with
its fairy glades and "built-up" temples. The last, too, is well off
for "cloths," pleasingly representing Padua and Verona. The performers
(with the exception of Mr. <span class="smcap">Stephen Phillips</span>, who speaks
his lines with admirable effect) are not so noticeable. One of the
best-played parts in the piece is filled by an actor whose name does
not appear in the programme. He has nothing to do but to carry
off <i>Katherina</i> (Mrs. <span class="smcap">F. R. Benson</span>), in Sc. 5., Act III., on his back.
That he looks like an ass while doing this goes without saying, but
still he is a valuable addition to the cast. From an announcement
in the programme, it appears that <i>Othello</i>, <i>Hamlet</i>, and the
<i>Merchant of Venice</i> are shortly to be played. It seems at the first
blush a difficult task to pick out of Mr. <span class="smcap">Benson's</span> present company
a gentleman quite suited to fill the title <i>r&ocirc;les</i> in the two first, and
<i>Shylock</i> in the last. But, no doubt, the Lessee and Manager thinks
the playing of the characters of the Prince of Denmark and the
Moor a matter of minor importance. And, if he does, it may be
argued, from the cordial reception that has been accorded to
<i>A Midsummer Night's Dream</i> and the <i>Taming of the Shrew</i>, that
he has an excellent reason for his opinion.</p>

<h2>HOW TO MEET IT.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;Having read all the letters
that have appeared in the papers suggesting a treatment for the
prevailing epidemic, I have got, perhaps, a little confused; but, on the
whole, the following is the course, as far as I can make out, that it
would be prudent to pursue on finding oneself threatened with any of the
well-known symptoms. Immediately get into a warm bath several degrees
hotter than you can possibly bear it, then get out again. Now go to bed,
send for your family solicitor, and make your will, meantime trying
every half hour half a tumbler or so of any patent medicine the
advertisement of which occurs to you. Call in a hom&oelig;opathic doctor,
and give his system a turn for four-and-twenty hours; then send for your
own medical man. Take care that they do not meet on the stairs. Take
anything and everything he gives you for the next eight-and-forty hours,
interspersing his prescriptions with frequent tumblers of hot and
steaming ammoniated quinine-and-water, getting down at the same time
more beef tea, oysters, champagne, muffins, mince-pies, oranges, nuts,
and whiskey than, under ordinary circumstances, you feel would be good
for you. Continue the above treatment for a couple of months. This is
what I am going to try, if I am down with it. As I said above, it is, if
a little complicated, sure to be all right, for I have got every item of
it from a careful perusal of those infallible guides and directors in
all modern difficulties and doubts,</p>

<h2>KICKED!</h2>

<p class='center'>(<i>By the Foot of Clara Groomley.</i>)</p>

<p class='center smcap'>Chapter II.</p>

<p>I am still at Ryde, and it is still raining. On a day like this, a
little Ryde goes a great way. No Ryde without rain. <i>Telle est la
vie.</i> The young girls at Plumfields sit writing themes indoors

<p>If this rain keeps on, I shall go to wild Assam again, or to the
Goodwin Sands. <span class="smcap">James</span>, the headwaiter, has
told me thirteen different stories of the haunted room of this hotel.
None of them are amusing, or interesting, or have anything to do with
this tale. If I were writing a shilling volume, I should put them in by
way of padding. As it is, they may go out. I too will go out.</p>

<hr class='short' />

<p>I have seen Mlle. <span class="smcap">Donnerwetter</span>. She was
racing along on the pier, and I was pacing along in the rear. I saw her
and caught her up. I hastily pressed all the valuables that I had with
me&mdash;four postage-stamps and an unserviceable watch-key&mdash;into
her hand, and entreated her to give me an interview with
Miss <span class="smcap">Smith</span>.</p>

<p>"Me muchee want to oblige English Sahib," she said, in her pulverised
English, "but ze Effendina&mdash;ze what you call 'ead-mistress, French
lady like myself&mdash;she no like it. She give me the <i>bottine</i>,
if I let great buckra massa talk to
Fraulein <span class="smcap">Smeets</span>. But lookee&mdash;I give you
straight tip. Miss <span class="smcap">Smeets</span> is on ze pier
now&mdash;you write note&mdash;slip it in her hand. I wink ze eyebrow. I
have a grand envy to oblige the English Signor. Ah! Bismillah! <i>Quelle
alouette!</i>"</p>

<p>She is French, very French, but she has a kind heart. I hurriedly
wrote a few impassioned words on my left cuff, and folded it into a
three-cornered note. I dropped it down
Miss <span class="smcap">Smeet's</span> neck as I found her leaning over
the side of the pier, and then ran away. I heard her murmur, "Someone's
mistaken me for the post-office."</p>

<p>It is still raining, but I am quite happy. I have seen her again, and
I feel that she loves me. It was impossible to mistake the
<i>tendresse</i> with which she murmured, "post-office." In my little
note I requested her to send a reply to this hotel. I have asked her
to tell me plainly what her income is, and to state on what conditions
she will forfeit it. Of course, she has no income now, as she is a
minor, but I would wait a year or two for a certainty. Shall I write
her some verses&mdash;lines to a minor, or thoughts on the Southampton
quay? Perhaps I had better wait until I obtain the statistics. Ah,
here is <span class="smcap">James</span>, bringing me a note. It must be from my darling&mdash;no,
it is from Mademoiselle.</p>

<blockquote><p><span class="smcap">Dear
Sir</span>,&mdash;Miss <span class="smcap">Smith</span> am going away to
Londres. A telegram come for her, and I look over the shoulder. It say,
'Poor <span class="smcap">Tommy's</span> kicked! Come at once,'
Miss <span class="smcap">Smith</span> make the tears.</p>

<p>
Yours,<br />
<span class="smcap">Lucia Donnerwetter</span>.
</p></blockquote>


<p>I must be off to London and get this matter
traced. <span class="smcap">James</span> entreats me to buy a new hat
when I am away. He says it's bringing disgrace on the hotel, and keeping
away custom. What! Give up the hat which her dear foot has kicked!
Never! But, perhaps, I will have it ironed. The iron has entered into my
soul, and perhaps, it would be doing more good on my hat. Yes, I will
have it ironed. It does look a little limp. Ironed or
starched&mdash;what matter, when my darling is gone, and left me with no
information as to her income?</p>

<h2>"BRITONS NEVER WILL BE SLAVES!"</h2>

<p class='center'>(<i>A Scene from a Domestic Comedy.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Bob Bull</span> was the wife of a British
Workman, and she got up at four o'clock in the morning.</p>

<p>"Must rise early," she said, "to see that my man has his
breakfast."</p>

<p>So she lighted the fire, and put the kettle on to boil, and laid the
cloth, and swept out the rooms. Then down
came <span class="smcap">Bob</span> rather in a bad humour, because he
had been late over-night at the "Cock and Bottle," detained (as he
explained to his wife) by a discussion about the rights of labour.</p>

<p>"Of course," said Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bull</span>; "and why
shouldn't you, after a hard day's work, enjoy yourself?"</p>

<p>But <span class="smcap">Bob</span> contended that he had not enjoyed
himself, although he had undoubtedly expended two shillings and
eight-pence upon refreshment. What <span class="smcap">Bob</span> wanted
to know was, why there was a button off his coat, and why his waistcoat
had not been properly mended.</p>

<p>"Well, I was busy with the children's things," replied
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bob</span>; "but I will put all straight when
you have gone to work."</p>

<p>"Gone to work, indeed!" grumbled <span class="smcap">Bob</span>.
"Yes, it's I that does all the work, and worse luck to it!"</p>

<p>The moment <span class="smcap">Bob</span> was out of the house,
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bob</span> got the children up and dressed
them, and gave them their breakfasts and sent them off to school. When
they were gone, she "tidied up" and dressed the baby. Then she did one
of "the bits of washing," that came from a family in whose service she
had been before she married
<span class="smcap">Bob</span>, and that family's connection. And this
occupied her fully, what with soaking, and mangling and ironing, until
it was time to carry <span class="smcap">Bob</span> his dinner. In the
pauses of her work she had been able to cook it, and it was quite ready
to go with her when she was prepared to take it. It was a long walk (in
the rain) to <span class="smcap">Bob's</span> place of work, and it
seemed the longer because she could not leave the baby. But both got
there, and the dinner, without any accident. And then
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bob</span> hurried back to give the children,
now home from school, <i>their</i> midday meal. And
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bob</span> had plenty of work to do afterwards.
She had to mend, and to scrub, and to sweep, and to sew. She was not off
her legs for a moment, and had she been a weaker woman, she would have
been thoroughly done up. Then came the children's evening toilette and
the cooking of <span class="smcap">Bob's</span> supper. Her lord and
master entered in due course, and she helped him off with his coat, and
(when he had finished his food) lighted his pipe for him.</p>

<p>"Mended my clothes?" asked <span class="smcap">Bob</span>.</p>

<p>"Of course I have."</p>

<p>"And washed my linen, and druv nails into my boots, and baked the
bread, and pickled the walnuts, and all the rest of it?"</p>

<p>"Yes, <span class="smcap">Bob</span>, I have done them
all&mdash;every one of them."</p>

<p>This put <span class="smcap">Bob</span> into a better temper, and he
took out an evening paper, and began to read it.</p>

<p>"I say," said he; "what do you think! They have got white slaves in
Turkey!"</p>

<p>"You don't say so, <span class="smcap">Bob</span>!" replied
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bob</span>, lost in amazement. Then she said as
she paused tidying up the room, "Ah! they wouldn't allow anything
of <i>that</i> sort in England!&mdash;would they,
<span class="smcap">Bob</span>?"</p>

<p>And <span class="smcap">Bob</span>, smoking his pipe, and sprawling
before the fire, agreed with her!</p>

<p>"Bring me my books!" said the Baron, not for the first time. But on
this occasion the Baron was a prisoner in bed, and likely to remain so
for many days. Consequently, he required amusement. He had heard of a
book, called <i>Three Men in a Boat</i>, by
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jerome K. Jerome</span>, some of whose
observations, in a collection of papers entitled
<i>Stage-land</i>, had caused him to laugh several times, and to smile
frequently, for the subject has not been so well touched since <span class="smcap">Gilbert
Abbott &agrave; Beckett</span> wrote his inimitable <i>Quizziology of the Drama</i>,
which for genuine drollery has never been surpassed. Anticipating,
then, some side-splitters from <i>Three Men in a Boat</i>, the Baron sent
for the work. He opened it with a chuckle, which, instead of developing
itself into a guffaw and then into a fit of uncontrollable laughter,
gradually subsided altogether, his smile vanished, and an expression
of weariness came over the Baron's face, as after heroically plodding
through five chapters he laid the book down, and sighed aloud,
"Well, I'm hanged if I see where the fun of this is." The
Baron may be wrong, and the humour of this book, which seems to
him to consist in weak imitations of American fun, and in conversations
garnished with such phrases as "bally idiot," "bally
tent," "doing a mouch," "boss the job," "put a pipe in his
mouth, and spread himself over a chair," "land him with a frying-pan,"
"fat-headed chunk," "who the thunder" and so forth&mdash;a style
the Baron believes to have been introduced from Yankee-land, and
patented here by the <i>Sporting Times</i> and its imitators,&mdash;interspersed
with plentiful allusions to whiskey-drinking, may not be, as it is not,
to his particular taste; and yet, for all that, it may be marvellously
funny. So the Baron requested an admirer of this book to pick out the
gems, and read them aloud to him. But even the admirer was compelled
to own that the gems did not sparkle so brilliantly as he had
at first thought. "Yet," observed the admirer, "it has had a big
sale." "<i>Three Men in a Boat</i> ought to have," quoth the Baron,
cheerily, and then he called aloud, "Bring me <i>Pickwick</i>!" He commenced
at the Review, and the first meeting of <i>Mr. Pickwick</i> with
the Wardle family. Within five minutes the Baron was shaking
with spasmodic laughter, and <span class="smcap">Charles Dickens's</span> drollery was as
irresistible as ever. Of course the Baron does not for one moment
mean to be so unfair to the <i>Three Men in a Boat</i> as to institute a
comparison between it and the immortal <i>Pickwick</i>, but he has heard
some young gentlemen, quite of the modern school, who profess
themselves intensely amused by such works as this, and as the two
books by the author of <i>Through Green Glasses</i>, and yet allow that
they could not find anything to laugh at in <i>Pickwick</i>. They did
not object to <i>Pickwick</i>, as ladies very often do, that there is so
much eating and drinking in it. "No," says the Baron, in bed,
"Give me my <i>Pickwick</i>, and, after him, for a soothing and pleasant
companion, give me <span class="smcap">Washington Irving</span>. When I'm in another
sort of humour, bring me <span class="smcap">Thackeray</span>. For rollicking Irish life, give
me <span class="smcap">Lever</span>. But as to youth-about-town life of the present day,
I do not know of any second-class humorist who approaches within
measurable distance of the author of <i>The Pottleton Legacy</i>, in the
past." So far the Baron. And now "The Co." speaks:&mdash;</p>

<p><i>A Tour in a Pha&euml;ton</i>, by J.
J. <span class="smcap">Hissey</span>, is an interesting account of a
driving trip through the Eastern Counties. It abounds in hisseytorical
research; we are taken to all kinds of out-of-the-way and picturesque
places, of which the Author gives us graphic pictures with pencil as
well as pen. A fresher title to the work might have been devised, as the
present one bears a striking likeness to Mr.
<span class="smcap">Black's</span> <i>Adventures of a Pha&euml;ton</i>,&mdash;who, by the way, was the first
to render driving tours popular. The volume abounds in poetical
quotations. The authority, however, is seldom given, and inverted
commas are conspicuous by their absence. It can hardly be imagined
that all this poetry is by the writer of the book. In one instance he
quotes a well-known verse by <span class="smcap">Ashby-Sterry</span>, without acknowledgment,
in which, for some inscrutable reason, he has introduced a
rugged final line which effectually mars the harmony of the original
stanza.</p>

<p>Those who prefer Scotch broth well peppered to Butter-Scotch, should
read <i>Our Journey to the Hebrides</i>, by Mr. and
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Pennell</span>. They seem to have gone out of
the beaten track in their tour, which is pleasant, and their views of
Scotland, though they may cause controversy, are novel, and at the same
time indescribably refreshing. As to the views of Scotland chronicled by
Mr. <span class="smcap">Pennell's</span> clever and facile pencil, they
are full of thought, elaborate detail and wondrous originality. There
are some forty of these, all remarkable for their everlasting variety
and high artistic excellence.</p>

<p><i>Dr. Hermione</i> (<i>Blackwood</i>) is rather an idyl than a
novel, and would have done better still if it had been cast in the form
of a comedy. The still anonymous author who followed up <i>Zit and
Zo&euml;</i> by <i>Lady Bluebeard</i> possesses the gift, rare among
novelists, of writing sparkling dialogue. The quickly changing scenes in
the last chapter of <i>Dr. Hermione</i>, with its sprightly chatter
would serve the poor player almost as it stands. It is not too late to
think about the comedy. In the meanwhile the novel does very well, and
if he had made his story a book for the play, we should have missed many
dainty descriptions of scenery. Nothing is so good as his description of
the Lake District in Autumn, unless it be his pictures of the
surroundings of the Nile as it</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

</div></div>

<p><i>Some Places of Note in England</i>
(<span class="smcap">Dowdeswells</span>) have been deftly noted by a
notable artist, namely, <span class="smcap">Birket Foster</span>. From
the "places of note," he has evolved some of the most delicate of
harmonies. Whether he gives us a Canterbury <i>cantata</i>, a Richmond
<i>rondo</i>, a Stratford symphony, a Lambeth <i>lied</i>, or a Tilbury <i>toccata</i>
we are equally delighted with his choice of <i>motivo</i> and his brilliancy
of execution. In this volume we have five-and-twenty pictures,
admirably reproduced in the highest style of lithography. Mr.
<span class="smcap">Birket Foster</span> has been before the public for many years&mdash;he
appeared, if we mistake not, in the early numbers of the <i>Illustrated
News</i>: his work has been constant, and his pictures countless ever
since, and yet, in the present volume, we find him better than ever.</p>

<p><i>Sporting Celebrities.</i> The first number of this new monthly
contains two excellent portraits by
M. <span class="smcap">Walery</span>. One is of the Duke of
<span class="smcap">Beaufort</span>, the other of Mr. <span class="smcap">Cholmondeley Pennell</span>. They are
accompanied by crisp well-written biographical notices. The two
portraits are well worth the price charged for the Magazine. A
couple of good photographs for a shilling, cannot be considered dear.
In addition to this, there are twenty pages of letterpress&mdash;so altogether
it is a splendid shillingsworth. <span class="smcap">Baron de Book-Worms &amp; Co.</span></p>

<h2>ANSWERS TO CORRESPONDENTS.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Insanitary Dust-bins.</span>&mdash;That your
servants should have thrown half a lobster, several potted meat-tins, an
uneatable rabbit-pie, and all the vegetable refuse of your household,
into your dust-bin, and that it should not have been "attended to" for
upwards of two months, is quite sufficient to account for the
intolerable odour of which you and all your neighbours on that side of
the street have had reason to complain; but, as you seem to think
nothing but an epidemic fever, caused by the nuisance, will rouse the
Authorities, you might, by throwing in a pound or two of phosphate of
lime, the same quantity of copper shavings, and a gallon or so of nitric
acid, as you suggest, create such an intolerable stench, that something
would have to be done, and that without delay, to preserve your entire
neighbourhood from a visitation of the plague. Try it, by all means. In
the meantime have a notice, as you propose, put in your kitchen window,
to the effect that a champagne luncheon, and half-a-crown a head, will
be provided for the dustmen if they will only call. Failing this, you
might take the steps you seriously contemplate, with a view to marrying
into the dust-contractor's family. This, perhaps, coupled with a series
of urgent letters to the <i>Times</i>, would be your wisest course. But,
in the present unsatisfactory state of the law, it is difficult to know
how to advise you for the best. Your idea, if the worst comes to the
worst, and you cannot get the Vestry to attend to it, of blowing up your
dust-bin yourself with gunpowder, you might resort to as a last
expedient; but, as you seem to think it might bring down your portico,
and possibly the whole front of your house as well, we should advise you
not to put it into execution till <i>quite</i> assured that your
attempts to get your dust-bin emptied by some less violent means have
all hopelessly failed. Anyhow, try the copper shavings and nitric acid
first. We think you will find, if steadily persevered in, that they
will, coupled, possibly, with some legal proceedings, settle the matter
for you.</p>

<h2>AN UNSCIENTIFIC DIALOGUE.</h2>

<p class='center'>(<i>On a highly Uninteresting Topic.</i>)</p>

<p><i>First Aspiring Political Economist</i> (<i>picking his way
cautiously</i>). What the Bimetallists maintain is this: that by fixing
an artificial ratio between the relative values of gold and silver, you
somehow (<i>a little vaguely</i>) keep up prices; and so, at
least,&mdash;so I fancy,&mdash;assist the circulation of capital. At all
events, that is what I take M. <span class="smcap">Emile de
Laveleye</span> to mean. (<i>Tentatively.</i>) You see that, don't
you?</p>

<p><i>Second Aspiring Political Economist.</i> Not a bit of it. Why,
<span class="smcap">Emile de Laveleye</span> is an ass. (<i>Emphatically.</i>) <span class="smcap">Giffen</span> says so.
And you can't have a higher authority than <span class="smcap">Giffen</span> (<i>clinching the
matter</i>). Why, he's Hon. Assistant Deputy Secretary to the Board
of Commerce; (<i>with animation</i>) in fact, he says that all Bimetallists
are hopeless lunatics, and, in my opinion, he's about right.</p>

<p><i>Third Aspiring Political Economist.</i> I don't see that at all.
But if you are going to settle the matter by merely quoting names, what
have you got to say to <span class="smcap">Foxwell</span>, the London
Professor? He's a Bimetallist, and no mistake.</p>

<p><i>Second Aspiring Political Economist.</i> "Got to say?" Why, ask
<span class="smcap">Levin</span> of Cambridge what he thinks of him. <span class="smcap">Levin</span> backs up <span class="smcap">Giffen</span>
in every word he says, and I agree with both of them. How can you
have two standards? (<i>Explicitly.</i>) The thing is preposterous.</p>

<p><i>First Aspiring Political Economist.</i> It is all very well to lay
down the law in that fashion, but it will not dispose of facts. You may
quote <span class="smcap">Giffen</span>,
or <span class="smcap">Levin</span>, or anyone you like, but they will
not be able to do away with the circumstance, that prices are regulated
by the quantity of money in circulation (<i>with a little
hesitation</i>); at least, that is what I understand the other side to
maintain.</p>

<p><i>Second Aspiring Political Economist.</i> Sheer nonsense. How does
the quantity of money you possess affect the price you pay for a
commodity? The fact of your having twenty sovereigns in your purse won't
make your butcher charge you an extra halfpenny a pound for a leg of
mutton! That must be clear to any fool!</p>

<p><i>First Aspiring Political Economist.</i> But you don't understand.
It's numbers that do it. They mean, if thirty millions of people, each
have twenty sovereigns a-piece in their purses (<i>doubtfully</i>),
<i>then</i>, I suppose, the butchers would raise the price of their meat.
At least, that's what I fancy they imply when they talk of an
"artificial currency" raising prices (<i>with some vagueness</i>), or is it
"artificial prices" creating an increased currency. I couldn't <i>quite</i>
follow them in this. But I am sure, whichever of the two views was
expressed by M. <span class="smcap">Emile de Laveleye</span>, that one had, no doubt, a
great deal of sound argument to back it.</p>

<p><i>Third Aspiring Political Economist.</i> I think you miss the
point. Take an illustration. Say you arrive at a cannibal island with
ten thousand complete sets of evening dress clothes, and that another
ship, just before the arrival of yours, has taken the last
ten-pound-note off the island, how, supposing there was to be a native
rush to obtain one of your suits, would the absence of any money to pay
for them affect their market value? I mayn't have got it quite
correctly, but this, or something like it, is one of the cases that
<span class="smcap">Giffen</span> brings forward to prove his point. The matter, however,
appears to me to be a little complicated.</p>

<p><i>Second Aspiring Political Economist.</i> Not in the least. It
proves the humbug of the Bimetallic position up to the hilt. Of course,
you must assume, that the cannibals desire to dress in evening clothes.
I confess that has to be considered, and then the question lies in a
nutshell. There can't be two opinions about it.</p>

<p><i>First Aspiring Political Economist.</i> Well, to me, though, of
course, I am willing to admit there <i>may</i> be something in it, I
can't say that the matter is, at first sight, convincingly clear.
(<i>Candidly.</i>) My chief difficulty is, I confess, to arrive at any
definite conclusion with myself, as to what "Bimetallism" really means,
and what it does not; and I own I feel still vague as to the two
questions of the influence of the quantity of money on prices, or the
price of a commodity on the value of money respectively, and, though I
carefully read all that appears in the daily papers on the subject, I am
compelled to own that I do not seem to be nearer a solution of the
perplexing difficulty. However, it is, no doubt, a highly absorbing, if
not a very useful, subject for investigation.</p>

<h2>MR. PUNCH'S MORAL MUSIC-HALL DRAMAS.</h2>

<p class='center'>No. IV.</p>

<p>Our present example is pure tragedy of the most ambitious kind, and
is, perhaps, a little in advance of the taste of a Music-hall audience
of the present day. When the fusion between the Theatres and the
Music-Halls is complete&mdash;when Miss <span class="smcap">Bessie
Bellwood</span> sings "<i>What Cheer, 'Ria?</i>" at the Lyceum, and
Mr. <span class="smcap">Henry Irving</span> gives his compressed version
of <i>Hamlet</i> at the Trocadero; when there is a general levelling-up
of culture, and removal of prejudice&mdash;then, and not till then, will
this powerful little play meet with the appreciation which is its due.
The main idea is suggested by the
Misses <span class="smcap">Taylor's</span> well-known poem, <i>The
Pin</i>, though the dramatist has gone further than the poetess in
working out the notion of Nemesis.</p>

<p><i>Emily</i> (<i>dreamily</i>). This day do I become the envied bride
of <span class="smcap">Peter</span>, justly surnamed
<span class="smcap">Paragon</span>; and much I wonder what in me he
found (he, who Perfection so personifies) that he could condescend an
eye to cast on faulty, feather-headed
<span class="smcap">Emily</span>! How solemn is the stillness all around
me! (<i>A loud bang is heard behind screen.</i>) Methought I heard the
dropping of a pin!&mdash;perhaps I should arise and search for it....
Yet why, on second thoughts, disturb myself, since I am, by my
settlements, to have a handsome sum allowed for pin-money? Nay, since
thou claim'st thy freedom, little pin, I lack the heart to keep thee
prisoner. Go, then, and join the great majority of fallen, vagrant,
unregarded pinhood&mdash;my bliss is too supreme at such an hour to heed
such infidelities as thine.</p>

<p><i>Peter</i> (<i>meditatively</i>). The golden sands of my celibacy
are running low&mdash;soon falls the final grain! Yet, even now, the
glass I would not turn. My <span class="smcap">Emily</span> is not
without her faults&mdash;"<i>was</i> not without them," I should rather
say, for during ten idyllic years of courtship, by precept and example I
have striven to mould her to a helpmate fit for me. Now, thank the Gods,
my labours are complete&mdash;she stands redeemed from all her
giddiness! (<i>Here he steps upon the pin, and utters an
exclamation</i>). Ha! what is this? I'm wounded ... agony! With what a
darting pain my foot's transfixed! I'll summon help (<i>with calm
courage</i>)&mdash;yet, stay, I would not dim this nuptial day by any
sombre cloud. I'll bear this stroke alone&mdash;and now to probe the
full extent of my calamity. (<i>Seats himself on sofa in such a position
as to be concealed by the screen from all but the audience, and proceeds
to remove his boot.</i>) Ye powers of Perfidy, it is a pin! I must know
more of this&mdash;for it is meet such criminal neglect should be
exposed. Severe shall be that house-maid's punishment who's proved to be
responsible for this!&mdash;but soft, I hear a step.</p>

It must be found, or I am all undone! In vain my cushion I have cut in

that all my future bliss depends on the evasive malice of a pin!</p>

<p class='ralign'>[<span class="smcap">Peter</span> <i>behind screen,

<p><i>Peter</i> (<i>aside</i>). A pin! what dire misgivings wring my

<p><i>Emily</i>

and may, for aught I know, be lamed for life.
Speak, <span class="smcap">Emily</span>, what is that maid's desert
whose carelessness has led to this mishap?</p>

<p><i>Emily</i> (<i>in the desperate hope of shielding herself</i>).
Why, should the fault be traced to any maid, instant dismissal shall be
her reward, with a month's wages paid in lieu of notice!</p>

<p><i>Peter</i> (<i>with a passionless severity</i>). From your own lips
I judge you, <span class="smcap">Emily</span>. Did they not own just now
that you had heard the falling of a pin&mdash;yet heeded not? Behold the

<p class='ralign'>[<i>Extends his injured foot.</i></p>

<p><i>Emily.</i> Oh, let me kiss the place and make it well!</p>

<p><i>Peter</i> (<i>coldly withdrawing foot</i>). Keep your caresses
till I ask for them. My wound goes deeper than you wot of yet, and by
that disregarded pin is pricked the iridescent bubble of Illusion!</p>

<p><i>Emily</i> (<i>slowly</i>). Indeed, I do not wholly comprehend.</p>

<p><i>Peter.</i> Have patience and I will be plainer yet. Mine is a
complex nature, <span class="smcap">Emily</span>; magnanimous, but still
methodical. An injury I freely can forgive, forget it&mdash;(<i>striking
his chest</i>)&mdash;never! She who leaves about pins on the floor to
pierce a lover's foot, will surely plant a thorn within the side of him
whose fate it is to be her husband!</p>

<p><i>Emily</i> (<i>dragging herself towards him on her knees</i>). Have
pity on me, <span class="smcap">Peter</span>; I was mad!</p>

<p><i>Peter</i> (<i>with emotion</i>). How can I choose but pity thee,
poor soul, who, for the sake of temporary ease, hast forfeited the bliss
that had been thine! You could not stoop to pick a pin up. Why? Because,
forsooth, 'twas but a paltry pin! Yet, duly husbanded, that self-same
pin had served you to secure your gaping train, your
self-respect&mdash;and Me.</p>

<p><i>Emily</i> (<i>wailing</i>). What have I done?</p>

<p><i>Peter.</i> I will not now reproach
you, <span class="smcap">Emily</span>, nor would I dwell upon my wounded
sole, the pain of which increases momently. I part from you in
friendship, and in proof, that fated instrument I leave with you
(<i>presenting her with the pin, which she accepts mechanically</i>)
which the frail link between us twain has severed. I can dispense with
it, for in my cuff (<i>shows her his coat-cuff, in which a row of
pins'-heads is perceptible</i>) I carry others 'gainst a time of need.
My poor success in life I trace to this&mdash;that never yet I passed a
pin unheeded.</p>

<p><i>Emily.</i> And is that all you have to say to me?</p>

<p><i>Peter.</i> I think so&mdash;save that I shall wish you well, and
pray that henceforth you may bear in mind what vast importance lies in
seeming trifles.</p>

<p><i>Emily</i> (<i>with a pale
smile</i>). <span class="smcap">Peter</span>, your lesson is already
learned, for precious has this pin become for me, since by its aid I
gain oblivion&mdash;thus!</p>

<p class='ralign'>[<i>Stabs herself.</i></p>

<p><i>Peter</i> (<i>coldly</i>). Nay, these are
histrionics, <span class="smcap">Emily</span>.</p>

<p class='ralign'>[<i>Assists her to sofa.</i></p>

<p><i>Emily.</i> I'd skill enough to find a vital spot. Do not withdraw
it yet&mdash;my time is short, and I have much to say before I die.
(<i>Faintly.</i>) Be gentle with my rabbits when I'm gone; give my
canary chickweed now and then.... I think there is no more&mdash;ah, one
last word&mdash;(<i>warmly</i>)&mdash;warn them they must not cut our
wedding-cake, and then the pastrycook may take it back!</p>

<p><i>Peter</i> (<i>deeply moved</i>). Would you had shown this
thoughtfulness before!</p>

<p class='ralign'>[<i>Kneels by the sofa.</i></p>

<p><i>Emily.</i> 'Tis now too late, and clearly do I see that I was
never worthy of you, <span class="smcap">Peter</span>.</p>

<p><i>Peter</i> (<i>gently</i>). 'Tis not for me to contradict you now.
You did your best to be so, <span class="smcap">Emily</span>!</p>

<p><i>Emily.</i> A blessing on you for those generous words! Now tell
me, <span class="smcap">Peter</span>, how is your poor foot?</p>

<p><i>Peter.</i> The agony decidedly abates, and I can bear a boot
again.</p>

<p><i>Emily.</i> Then I die happy!... Kiss
me, <span class="smcap">Peter</span> ... ah!</p>

<p class='ralign'>[<i>Dies.</i></p>

<p><i>Peter.</i> In peace she passed away. I'm glad of that, although
that peace was purchased by a lie. I shall not bear a boot for many
days! Thus ends our wedding morn, and she, poor child, has paid the
penalty of heedlessness!</p>
